        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Who says being a vegetarian means you have to miss out on your favorite meals?</p>
            <p>This dish is inspired by the classic Beef Bolognese, only without the meat. The taste is derived from the assortment of seasonings, spices, herbs, and sauces that add a twist and boost flavor, mimicking the savory taste of beef bolognese without the sacrifice of a cow. </p>
            <p>This dish can be mixed & matched by playing around with the style of pasta, type of sauce, and variety of herbs, seasonings, and spices used. Find the perfect match for your taste buds or occasion! A family favorite that can be enjoyed timelessly.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta of choice<p>-mix & match different styles of pasta, or use themed pasta for some festivity fun</p></li>
                <li>Sauce<p>-Arrabiata sauce is preferable, but can also use marinara, tomato, or vodka sauce (as long as it is vegetarian)</p></li>
                <li>Nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
                <li>Meatless beef crumbles<p>-I prefer Impossible Beef, but use your brand of choice, preferably crumbles</p></li>
                <li>Herbs, spices, & seasonings<p>-Vary spice level on tolerance. You can play around with what you add. I typically add Italian herbs, beef seasoning, Adobo, paprika, ginger, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, chili flakes, peppercorn, sea or regular salt</p></li>
                <li>Oil (olive, castor, sesame, etc)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure to thaw frozen meatless meat if necessary</li>
                <li>Fill a large pot with water, sprinkle some salt, and bring to a boil</li>
                <li>In a large skillet (preferably cast-iron), drizzle some oil and place on low-to-medium heat</li>
                <li>Add meatless beef crumbles to skillet and break up with wooden spoon, ensuring even distribution over heat</li>
                <li>Loosely place a lid over the skillet and allow the crumbles to slowly cook (depending on brand, color should become darker as it cooks)</li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add pasta of choice, making sure to stir often to avoid sticking together</li>
                <li>When meatless crumbles are browning, add spices and stir evenly into the mixture</li>
                <li>Add sauce of choice into the skillet with "meat" and mix thoroughly</li>
                <li>Add more seasonings or garnishing into the sauce mixture as needed</li>
                <li>Once pasta is at right texture (I prefer mine al dante), drain water and place back into large pot</li>
                <li>Add sauce and "meat" mixture to pasta and mix together, ensuring even distribution of sauce over pasta</li>
                <li>Place lid over pot and allow to sit for a few minutes to marinate in flavors</li>
                <li>Garnish as needed (optional)</li>
                <li>Voila! Enjoy with a dash of Nutritional Yeast or some bread</li>
