        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Kick your hunger to the curb with this bountiful smoothie rich in antioxidants and protein. Perfect for a busy morning or post-workout replenishment to give your metabolism a boost whilst meeting all your nutrient needs. Measurements can be scaled up to be used as a meal replacement, or scaled down to drink as a supplement. Whichever you choose, the smoothie is guaranteed to tantalize your taste buds and provide a boost of energy.</p>
            <p>Mix & match your favorite fruits to match the season, and try different combinations of protein sources to make this smoothie your very own.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fruit of choice<p>If you're looking for a creamy texture, bananas are best. For a juicier experience, you can't go wrong with an array of berries. Get creative and try different flavors & combinations!</p></li>
                <li>Protein powder of choice<p>If you have a more sensitive stomach, I recommend powder without whey as these can sit heavily. Whichever you choose, make sure there is an adequate amount of protein, preferably 25g or more. I like to change up the powder depending on whether I need a muscle recovery boost after a hard work-out or a nutrition boost to replace a sit down meal.</p></li>
                <li>Protein-rich milk, preferably flax or nut based<p>Karma makes a great flaxseed milk with a whopping 8g of protein in each cup. Silk also has protein-rich nut or soy milks, some with more protein than others. While the 20g soy protein milk is packed with protein, it has a thicker consistency and is best paired with a lighter milk such as cashew or flaxseed. It is best to avoid almond milks as these are not very sustainably sourced.</p></li>
                <li>Garnish of choice<p>Boost your flavor pallet with a drizzle of honey, agave syrup, or chocolate swirl. This is optional but definitely provides a flavor boost!</p></li>
                <li>Water & ice</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
